I noticed in the credits for the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mouthwashing</a> that stock footage was credited to a link on archive.org. This led me to find a massive collection of very usable (and CC licensed) stock footage.
