<p>Error 404 page on adultswim.com. I think 404 pages are a great place for creative freedom.</p>
<ol>
    <li>because it can relieve the user's frustration at having their journey interrupted by an error</li>
    <li>there's not many other places on most websites that allow designers/developers to create something pointless and fun</li>
</ol>
<p>Adult Swim opted to display an existential crisis from the voice of the website. Never seen something like this on an error page before.</p>
